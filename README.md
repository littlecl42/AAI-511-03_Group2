### Project Description

Music is a form of art that is ubiquitous and has a rich history. Different composers have created music with their unique styles and compositions. However, identifying the composer of a particular piece of music can be a challenging task, especially for novice musicians or listeners. The proposed project aims to use deep learning techniques to identify the composer of a given piece of music accurately.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a given musical score accurately. The project aims to accomplish this objective by using two deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
